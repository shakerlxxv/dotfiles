Mac / Linux system environment configuration files.

## Installation


Run `./install.sh` from inside of the cloned project.
It will link the files in the project directory to their `~/.file` equivalents.

## bash


## tmux

This configuration was largely based on the book __tmux - Productive Mouse Free Development__ by Brian Hogan.

## Spacemacs

The `.spacemacs` file is mostly setup around using [Alchemist](https://github.com/tonini/alchemist.el) with [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) projects.
